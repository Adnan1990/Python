    "### Define Object Oriented Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "An Object is a thing (Realworld entitiy).Object oriented programming language is a language which deals with objects.Object oriented programming (OOP) aims to implement real world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and its functions are said to be encapsulated into a single entity\n",
    "Data encapsulation and data hiding are the key terms in the description of object oriented languages"

    "### List down the Benefits of OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP was developed to overcome the limitations of the traditional programming languages.As the programs gets larger in procedural programming it becomes more complex to understand the logic and implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes\n",
    "\n",
    "Reuse also enables faster development. Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer. This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help them get more work done; finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain. OOP programmers take new and existing software objects and \"stitch\" them together to make new programs. Because object libraries contain many useful functions, software developers don't have to reinvent the wheel as often; more of their time goes into making the new program.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good for defining abstract data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation details are hidden from other modules and other modules has a clearly defined interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to maintain and modify existing code as new objects can be created with small differences to existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "objects, methods, instance, message passing, inheritance are some important properties provided by these particular languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction are also counts in these fundamentals of programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "It implements real life scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, programmer not only defines data types but also deals with operations applied for data structures.\n"

    "It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value).\n",

    "\n",
    "1)A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.\n",
    "2)A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data)."
